## Contribution

This library needs:

- Unit tests (See [here](https://github.com/MelbourneDeveloper/Device.Net/blob/7af1cc461ef79685a3499f87a450208b3a36a62e/src/Device.Net.UnitTests/UnitTests.cs#L23) )
- Bug fixes (See [here](https://github.com/MelbourneDeveloper/Device.Net/issues) )
- Documentation. Please add and fix up the XML Doc. This makes a big difference!
- More platform support. Particularly for macOS and Linux

I welcome feedback, and pull requests. If there's something that you need to change in the library, please log an issue, and explain the problem. If you have a proposed solution, please write it up and explain why you think it is the answer to the problem. The best way to highlight a bug is to submit a pull request with a unit test that fails so I can clearly see what the problem is in the first place.

## Pull Requests

Please break pull requests up in to their smallest possible parts. If you have a small feature or refactor that other code depends on, try submitting that first. Please try to reference an issue so that I understand the context of the pull request. If there is no issue, I don't know what the code is about.

**Please submit pull requests to the develop branch. Please do not submit to the master branch**
